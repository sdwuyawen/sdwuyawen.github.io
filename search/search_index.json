I am building next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) for mobile devices. Prior to Qualcomm, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Notre Dame working with Dr. Yiyu Shi, starting in Spring 2023. Prior to Notre Dame, I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Pittsburgh in Feb. 2023 advised by Dr. Jingtong Hu. I am open to various kinds of collaboration, please drop me an email if you are interested in my research. </p> <p>I received the MICCAI Young Scientist Award Nomination for my work on medical applications of on-device AI. My research internships at Meta and Baidu USA have resulted in technologies delivered to industrial production.</p>"},{"location":"#recent-news","title":"Recent News","text":"<ul> <li>02/2024: Invited to be an MICCAI 2024 reviewer.</li> <li>02/2024: Invited to be a GLSVLSI 2024 TPC member.</li> <li>01/2024: Invited to be an ACCV 2024 reviewer.</li> <li>01/2024: Invited to be an ECCV 2024 reviewer.</li> <li>10/2022: Invited to be a CVPR 2024 reviewer.</li> <li>07/2023: Invited to be the AAAI 2024 Program Committee (PC).</li> <li>05/2023: One paper was accepted to MICCAI 2023 (Early acceptance). </li> <li>05/2022: Invited to be a MICCAI 2023 Distributed, Collaborative and Federated Learning Workshop reviewer.</li> <li>05/2023: I started my new position as a Senior Research Engineer at Qualcomm, developing next-generation mobile vision technologies.</li> <li>05/2023: Our paper about federated self-supervised learning from streaming data is accepted by TCAD.</li> <li>05/2023: Invited to be an ICCAD 2023 TPC member.</li> <li>04/2023: Invited to be an ASP-DAC 2024 TPC member.</li> <li>03/2023: Invited to be a NeurIPS 2023 reviewer.</li> <li>03/2023: I started my new position as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University * of Notre Dame. </li> <li>02/2023: I successfully defended my Ph.D. dissertation.</li> <li>02/2023: Invited to be an ICCV 2023 reviewer.</li> <li>02/2023: Invited to be a MICCAI 2023 reviewer.</li> <li>02/2023: Invited to be a KDD 2023 PC member.</li> <li>01/2023: Invited to be a GLSVLSI 2023 TPC member.</li> <li>12/2022: Our paper about self-supervised learning is accepted by AAAI 2023 (Oral presentation).</li> <li>10/2022: Invited to be a CVPR 2023 reviewer.</li> <li>10/2022: Invited to be a NeurIPS 2022 MetaLearn Workshop reviewer.</li> <li>07/2022: Invited to be a MICCAI 2022 Distributed, Collaborative and Federated Learning * Workshop reviewer.</li> <li>05/2022: Invited to be an ECCV 2022 reviewer.</li> <li>05/2022: I started my new position as a machine learning research intern at Meta.</li> <li>04/2022: Our paper about self-supervised federated learning is accepted by IJCAI 2022.</li> <li>02/2022: Invited to be a MICCAI 2023 reviewer.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#research-interests","title":"Research Interests","text":"<p>Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Hardware/Software Co-Design, Embedded Systems, IoT, On-Device AI, Medical/Health Applications.</p>"},{"location":"#professional-experience","title":"Professional Experience","text":"<p>1, Senior Research Engineer - Qualcomm Technologies Inc, San Diego, CA, USA.
